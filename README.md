# Strong-Password-Generator

Bootcamp Challenge 03 - JavaScript: An interactive webpage that generates a unique password between 8 - 128 characters

## The Challenge

Apply JavaScript to a webpage designed to generate a password that meets certain criteria, creating a strong password that provides greater security.

Acceptance criteria for the webpage:
- Upon opening up the webpage, there will be a text box where your password will be generated and a button below that box
- When that button is pressed, you are presented with a series of prompts for the password criteria
- The prompts will confirm the length is within 8 to 128 characters, and whether or not to include the following:
    - lower case letters
    - upper case letters
    - numbers
    - special characters
- A password is generated as long as one character type was confirmed
- When all prompts are answered a customized password fitted to the desired length shall be generated
- The password will generate in the placeholder position before the prompts were answered

## Mock-Up
